 * function: isVampireNumber(int number, int& first, int& second)
 * usage: isVampireNumber(number, first, second)
 * -------------------
 * Returns TRUE if number is a vampire number, and sets first and second to its
 * fangs.  Otherwise it returns FALSE.  All unique permutations of number are generated
 * and stored in a set.  These permutations are looped through, and first is set to
 * the first half of each permutation and second is set to the second half.  If the first
 * half times the second half equals the number, then first and second are the fangs
 * and number is a vampire number.
 *
 * I thought of what I think would be a more efficient algorithm, but I did not have time
 * to implement it.  The fangs are built from the ones digit up, and only combinations of
 * ones digits such that the ones digit of first multiplied by the ones digit of second
 * will give a result that's ones digit is equal to the ones digit of number.  If the ones
 * digit of first and second multiply to something else, then first and second obviously
 * could not be fangs.  Possible values for the ones digits in the fangs are then built
 * upon with possible values for the 10s digit using the same logic.  The last two digits of
 * the fangs must multiply to the last two digits of the number.
 * An example: 1827 is a vampire number.  The last digits of the fangs must be 1 and 7, as
 * 1*8 != x7, 1*2 != x7, 8*2 != x7, and 8*7 != x7.  Possibilities for the 10s digits are then
 * 8 and 2.  27*81 = xx87, not xx27, so that is thrown out.  That leaves 87*21 = xx27.  All
 * digits of the parent number have been used, and we have one posibility.  87*21 = 1827, our
 * answer.
 * I imagine just explaining my algorithm and not implementing it is not enough for a +, but
 * I was proud of the idea and wanted to share it anyway.
